=head1 NAME

TM::Materialized::MLDBM2 - Topic Maps, DBM Storage (synchronous)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use TM::Materialized::MLDBM2;
   {
    my $tm = new TM::Materialized::MLDBM2 (file => '/tmp/map.dbm');
    # modify the map here.....

    } # it goes out of scope here, and all changes are written back automagically

   # later in the game
   {
    my $tm = new TM::Materialized::MLDBM2 (file => '/tmp/map.dbm');
    # we are back in business, no sync necessary
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package just implements L<TM> with a BerkeleyDB store. Unlike L<TM::Materialized::MLDBM> this
module does not need explicit synchronisation with the external resource (the DBM file here).  It
ties content-wise with the DBM file at constructor time and unties at DESTROY time.

The advantage of this storage form is that there is little memory usage. Only those fractions of the
map are loaded which are actually needed. If one has very intense interactions with the map (as a
query processor has), then this storage technique is not optimal.

=head1 INTERFACE

=head2 Constructor

The constructor expects a hash with the following keys:

=over

=item B<file> (no default)

This contains the file name of the DBM file to tie to.
