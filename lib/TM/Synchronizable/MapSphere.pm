=head1 NAME

TM::Synchronizable::MapSphere - Topic Maps, trait for a syncing a hierarchical TM repository

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use TM;
   use base qw(TM);
   use Class::Trait ('TM::MapSphere',
                     'TM::Synchronizable::MLDBM' => {
   		         exclude => [ "sync_in", "sync_out" ]
   		     },
                     'TM::Synchronizable::MapSphere');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This trait adds C<sync_in> and C<sync_out> functionality to a map sphere. The
point here is that embedded child maps are also synced out or in.

=item B<sync_in>

I<$ms>->sync_in (I<$path>)

A whole subtree of the map repository can be I<sync'ed in>, i.e. synchronized with contents in an
associated resource. If this method is triggered with a particular path, then the map there will be
(a) synced in, (b) queried for sub-maps and (c) these sub-maps will be instantiated.  Recursively,
these submaps will be sync'ed in, etc. All these sub maps will be mounted under this branch of the
tree.

When a map is instantiated, its implementation package will be extracted from the parent map using a
C<implementation> characteristic. The resource URL will be determined from one of the subject
indicators, the base URI will be determined from the subject address of the map topic. If any of
these are missing, this particular sub-map is ignored.

B<Example>: Let us assume that a map has a C<baseuri> C<http://whatever/> and a resource URL
C<http://example.org/here.xtm>. It is a materialized map using the XTM driver. If this map is
mounted into a root map under C</foo/>, then the entry will take the form (using AsTMa= 2.0 as
notation):

   foo isa topicmap
   ~ http://example.org/here.xtm
   = http://whatever/
   implementation: TM::Materialized::XTM

=item B<sync_out>

I<$ms>->sync_out ([ I<$path> ], [ I<$depth> ])

This method syncs out not only the root map sphere object (at least if the resource C<mtime> is
earlier that any change on the map sphere). The method also consults the mount tab to find child
maps and will sync them out as well.

The optional C<path> parameter controls which subtree should be synced out. It defaults to C</>.

The optional C<$depth> controls how deep the subtree should be followed downwards. Default is
C<MAX_DEPTH> (see the source).
