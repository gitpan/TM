=head1 ABSTRACT

This class provides read/write access to a data structure according to the Topic Maps paradigm. As
it stands, this class implements directly so-called I<materialized> maps, i.e. those maps which
completely reside in memory. Implementations for non-materialized maps can be derived from it.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class implements directly so-called I<materialized> topic maps, i.e. those maps which
completely reside in memory. Non-materialized and non-materializable maps can be implemented by
deriving from this class by overloading one or all of the sub-interfaces. If this is done cleverly,
then any application, even a TMQL query processor can operate on non-materialized (virtual) maps in
the same way as on materialized ones.

=head2 Data Structures

The Topic Maps paradigm knows two abstractions

=over

=item I<TMDM>, Topic Maps Data Model 

L<http://www.isotopicmaps.org/sam/sam-model/>

=item I<TMRM>, Topic Maps Reference Model 

L<http://www.isotopicmaps.org/tmrm/>

=back

For historical reasons, this package adopts an abstraction which is in between these
two. Accordingly, there are only following types of data structures

=over

=item Toplets:

These are like TMDM topics, but only contain addressing information (subject identifiers and subject
addresses) along with an internal identifier.

=item Assertions:

These are like TMDM associations, but are generalized to host also occurrences and names. Also
associations using predefined association types, such as C<isa> (I<instance-class>) and C<iko>
(I<subtype-supertype>) are represented as assertions.

=item Variants:

No idea what they are good for. They can be probably safely ignored.

=back

The data manipulation interface is very low-level and B<directly> exposes internal data structures.
As long as you do not mess with the information you get and you follow the API rules, this can
provide a convenient, fast, albeit not overly comfortable interface. If you prefer more a TMDM-like
style of accessing a map then have a look at L<TM::DM>.


=head2 Identifiers

Of course, L<TM> supports the subject locator and the subject indicator mechanism as mandated
by the Topic Maps standards.

Additionally, this package also uses I<internal> identifiers to address everything which looks and
smells like a topic, also associations, names and occurrences. For topics the application (or
author) of the topic map will most likely provide these internal identifiers. For the others the
identifiers are generated.

Since v1.31 this package distinguishes between 3 kinds of internal identifiers:

=over

=item I<canonicalized> toplet identifiers

These identifiers are always interpreted local to a map, in that the C<baseuri> of the map is used
as prefix. So, a local identifier

  chinese-working-conditions

will become

  tm://nirvana/chinese-working-conditions

if the base URI of the map were

  tm://nirvana/

So if you want to use identifiers such as these, then you should either use the absolut version
(including the base URI) or use the method C<tids> to find the absolute version.

=item I<sacrosanct> toplet identifiers

All toplets from the infrastructure are declared I<sacrosanct>, i.e. untouchable. Examples are
C<isa>, C<class> or C<us> (universal scope).

These identifiers are always the same in all maps this package system manages. That implies that if
you use such an identifier, then you cannot attach a local meaning to it. And it implies that at
merging time, toplets with these identifiers will merge. Even if there were no subject indicators or
addresses involved.

It is probably a good idea to leave such toplets alone as the software is relying on the stability
of the sacrosanct identifiers.

=item assertion identifiers

Each assertion also has an (internal) identifier. It is a function from the content, so it
is characteristic for the assertion.

=back

=head2 Consistency

An application using a map may expect that a map is I<consolidated>, i.e. that the following
consistency conditions are met:

=over

=item B<A1> (fixed on)

Every identifier appearing in some assertion as type, scope, role or player is also registered as
toplet.

=item B<Indicator_based_Merging> (default: on)

Two (or more) toplets sharing the same I<subject identifier> are treated as one toplet.

=item B<Subject_based_Merging> (default: on)

Two (or more) toplets sharing the same I<subject locator> are treated as one toplet.

=item B<TNC_based_Merging> (default: off)

Two (or more) toplet sharing the same name in the same scope are treated as one toplet.

=back

=cut

use constant {
    Subject_based_Merging   => 1,
    Indicator_based_Merging => 2,
    TNC_based_Merging       => 3,
};

=pod

While A1 is related with the internal consistency of the data structure (see C<insane>), the others
are a choice the application can make (see C<consistency>).

I<Consistency> is not automatically provided when a map is modified by the application. It is the
applications responsibility to trigger the process to consolidate the map. As that may be
potentially expensive, the control remains at the application.

When an IO driver is consuming a map from a resource, say, loading from an XTM file, then that
driver will ensure that the map is consolidated according to the current settings before it hands it
to the application. The application is then in full control of the map as it can change, add and
delete toplets and assertions. The map can become unconsolidated in this process. The method
C<consolidate> reinstates consistency again.

You can change these defaults by (a) providing an additional option to the constructor

   new TM (....,
           consistency => [ TM->Subject_based_Merging,
                            TM->Indicator_based_Merging ]);

or (b) by later using the accessor C<consistency> (see below).

=head1 MAP INTERFACE

=head2 Constructor

I<$tm> = new TM (...)

The constructor will create an empty map, or, to be more exact, it will fill the map with the
taxonomy from L<TM::PSI> which covers basic Topic Maps concepts such as I<topic> or I<associations>.

The constructor understands a number of key/value pair parameters:

=over

=item C<baseuri> (default: C<tm://nirvana/>)

Every toplet in the map has an unique local identifier (e.g. C<shoesize>). The C<baseuri> parameter
controls how an absolute URI is built from this identifier.

=item C<consistency> (default: [ Subject_based_Merging, Indicator_based_Merging ])

This controls the consistency settings. They can be changed later with the C<consistency> method.

=head2 Methods

=pod

=item B<consistency>

I<@merging_constraints> = I<$tm>->consistency

I<$tm>->consistency (I<@list_of_consistency_constants>)

This method provides read/write access to the consistency settings.

If no parameters are provided, then the current list of consistency settings is returned. If
parameters are provided, that list must consist of the constants defined under L</Consistency>.

B<NOTE>: Changing the consistency does B<NOT> automatically trigger C<consolidate>.

=cut

sub consistency {
  my $self   = shift;
  my @params = @_;

  $self->{consistency} = [ @params ] if @params;
  return @{$self->{consistency}};
}

=pod

=item B<last_mod>

Returns the L<Time::HiRes> date of last time the map has been modified (content-wise).

=cut

sub last_mod {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->{last_mod};
}

=pod

=item B<consolidate>

I<$tm>->consolidate

I<$tm>->consolidate (I<@list_of_consistency_constants>)

This method I<consolidates> a map by performing the following actions:

=over

=item * 

perform merging based on subject address (see TMDM section 5.3.2)

=item * 

perform merging based on subject indicators (see TMDM section 5.3.2)

=item * 

remove all superfluous toplets (those which do not take part in any assertion)

B<NOTE>: Not implemented yet!

=back

This method will normally use the map's consistency settings. These settings can be overridden by
adding consistency settings as parameters (see L</Consistency>). In that case the map's settings are
B<not> modified, so use this carefully.

B<NOTE>: In all cases the map will be modified.

B<NOTE>: After merging some of the I<lids> might not be reliably point to a topic.

=item B<add>

I<$tm>->add (I<$tm2>, ...)

This method accepts a list of L<TM> objects and adds all content from these maps to the current
object.

B<NOTE>: There is B<NO> merging done for user-supplied toplets. Use explicitly method C<consolidate>
for it. Merging is done for all sacrosanct toplets, i.e. those from the infrastructure.

From v1.31 onwards this method tries to favour the I<internal> identifiers (LIDs) of B<this> map
over LIDs of the added maps. This means, firstly, that internal identifiers of B<this> map are
B<not> touched (or re-generated) in any way and that any shorthands (without a baseuri prefix) will
remain valid when using C<tids>. Secondly, LIDs in the added map will be attempted to blend into
B<this> map by changing simply their prefix. If that newly generated LID is already taken by
something in B<this> map, then the original LID will be used. That allows many added LIDs be used
together with C<tids> without (much) change in code. Of course, the only reliable way to reach a
topic is a subject locator or an indicator. This is all about convenience.

B<NOTE>: This procedure implies that some assertions are recomputed, so that also their LID will
change!

=item B<diff>

I<$diff> = I<$new_tm>->diff (I<$old_tm>)

I<$diff> = TM::diff (I<$new_tm>, I<$old_tm>)

I<$diff> = TM::diff (I<$new_tm>, I<$old_tm>, 
                     {consistency => \ @list_of_consistency_consts,
                      include_changes => 1})

C<diff> compares two topic maps and returns their differences as a hash reference. While it works on
any two maps, it is most useful after one map (the I<old map>) is modified into a I<new map>.

If C<diff> is used in OO-style, the current map is interpreted as the I<new> map and the map in the
arguments as I<the old one>.

By default, the toplet and assertion identifiers for any changes are returned; the option
C<include_changes> causes the return of the actual toplets and assertions themselves. This option
makes C<diff>'s output more self-contained: enabled, one can fully (re)create the new map from the
old one using the diff (or vice versa).

The C<consistency> option uses the same format as the TM constructor (see L</Constructor>) and
describes how corresponding toplets in the two maps are to be identified.  Toplets with the same
internal ids are always considered equal. If I<subject based consistency> is active, toplets with
the same I<subject locator> are considered equal (overriding the topic identities).  If I<indicator
based consistency> is active, toplets with a matching I<subject indicator> are considered equal
(overriding the previous identities).

B<NOTE>: This overriding of previous conditions for identity is necessary to keep the equality
relationship unique and one-to-one.  As an example, consider the following scenario: a toplet I<a>
in the old map is split into multiple new toplets I<a> and I<b> in the new map. If I<a> had a
locator or identifier that is moved to I<b> (and if consistency options were active), then the
identity detector will consider I<b> to be equal to I<a>, and B<not> I<a> in the new map to
correspond to I<a> in the old map.  However, this will never lead to loss of information: I<a> in
the new map is flagged as completely new toplet.

The differences between old and new map are returned underneath the keys I<plus>, I<minus>,
I<identities> and I<modified>. If C<include_changes> is on, the extra keys I<plus_midlets>,
I<minus_midlets> and I<assertions> are populated. The values of all these keys are hash references
themselves.

=over

=item I<plus>, I<minus>

The C<plus> and C<minus> hashes list new or removed toplets, respectively (with their identifiers as
keys).  For each toplet, the value of the hash is an array of associated assertion ids. The array is
empty but defined if there are no associated assertions.

For toplets the attached assertions are the usual ones (names, occurrences) and class-instance
relationships (attached to the instance toplet).

For associations, the assertions are attached to the I<type> toplet.

=item I<identities>

This hash consists of the non-trivial toplet identities that were found. If neither Subject- nor
Indicator-based merging is active, then this hash is empty. Otherwise, the keys are toplet
identifiers in the old map, with the corresponding toplet identifier in the new map as value.

=item I<modified>

The I<modified> hash contains the changes for matched toplets. The key is the toplet identifier in
the old map (which is potentially different from the one in the new map; see the note about
identities above). The value is a hash with three keys: I<plus>, I<minus> and I<identities>.  The
value for the C<identities> key is defined if and only if the toplet associated with this toplet has
changed (i.e. Subject Locator or Indicators have changed).  The values for the C<plus> and C<minus>
keys are arrays with the new or removed assertions that are attached to this toplet. These arrays are
defined but empty where no applicable information is present.

=item I<plus_midlets>, I<minus_midlets>

These hashes hold the actual new or removed toplets if the option C<include_changes> is active.
Keys are the toplet ids, values are references to the actual toplet data structures.

=item I<assertions>

This hash holds the actual assertions where the maps differ; it exists only if the option
C<include_changes> is active. Keys are the assertion identifiers, values the references to the
actual assertion data structure. Note that assertion ids uniquely identify the assertion contents,
therefore this hash can hold assertions from both new and old map.

=head1 TOPLET INTERFACE

I<Toplets> are light-weight versions of TMDM topics. They only carry addressing information and are
represented by an array (struct) with the following fields:

=cut

struct 'Toplet' => [
    lid         => '$',
    saddr       => '$',
    sinds       => '$',
];

=pod

=over

=item C<lid> (index: C<LID>)

The internal identifier. Mostly it repeats the key in the toplet hash, but also aliased identifiers
may exist.

=item C<saddr> (index: C<ADDRESS>)

It contains the B<subject locator> (address) URI, if known. Otherwise C<undef>.

=item C<sinds> (index: C<INDICATORS>)

This is a reference to a list containing B<subject identifiers> (indicators). The list can be empty,
no duplicate removal is attempted at this stage.

=back

You can create this structure manually, but mostly you would leave it to C<internalize> to do the
work.

Example:

   # dogmatic way to produce it
   my $to = Toplet->new (lid   => $baseuri . 'my-lovely-cat',
                         saddr => 'http://subject-address.com/',
                         sinds => []);

   # also good and well
   my $to = [ $baseuri . 'my-lovely-cat', 
              'http://subject-address.com/',
               [] ];

   # better
   my $to = $tm->internalize ('my-lovely-cat' => 'http://subject-address.com/');

To access the individual fields, you can either use the struct accessors C<saddr> and C<sinds>, or
use the constants defined above for indices into the array:

=cut

use constant {
#   LID        => 0,
    ADDRESS    => 1,
    INDICATORS => 2
};

=pod

Example:

   warn "indicators: ", join (", ", @{$to->sinds});

   warn "locator:    ", $to->[TM->ADDRESS];

=head2 Methods

=over

=item B<internalize>

I<$iid>  = I<$tm>->internalize (I<$some_id>)

I<$iid>  = I<$tm>->internalize (I<$some_id> => I<$some_id>)

I<@iids> = I<$tm>->internalize (I<$some_id> => I<$some_id>, ...)

This method does some trickery when a new toplet should be added to the map, depending on how
parameters are passed into it. The general scheme is that pairs of identifiers are passed in.  The
first is usually the internal identifier, the second a subject identifier or the subject
locator. The convention is that subject identifier URIs are passed in as string references, whereas
subject locator URIs are passed in as strings.

The following cases are covered:

=over

=item C<ID =E<gt> undef>

If the ID is already an absolute URI and contains the C<baseuri> of the map as prefix, then this URI
is used as internal toplet identifier. If the ID is some other URI, then a toplet with that URI as
subject locator is searched in the map. If such a toplet already exists, then nothing special needs
to happen.  If no such toplet existed, a new URI, based on the C<baseuri> and a random number will
be created for the internal identifier and the original URI is used as subject address.

B<NOTE>: Using C<URI =E<gt> URI> implies that you use two different URIs as subject addresses. This
will result in an error.

=item C<ID =E<gt> URI>

Like above, only that the URI is directly interpreted as subject address.

=item C<ID =E<gt> \ URI> (reference to string)

Like above, only that the URI is interpreted as another subject identifier. If the toplet already existed,
then this subject identifier is simply added. Duplicates are suppressed (since v1.31).

=item C<undef =E<gt> URI>

Like above, only that the internal identifier is auto-created if there is no toplet with the URI
as subject address.

=item C<undef =E<gt> \ URI>

Like above, only that the URI us used as subject identifier.

=item C<undef =E<gt> undef>

A toplet with an auto-generated ID will be inserted.

=back

In any case, the internal identifier(s) of all inserted (or existing) toplets are returned for
convenience.

This function returns toplet structures from the map. B<NOTE>: This has changed from v 1.13. Before
you got ids.

If no parameter is provided, all toplets are returned. This includes really everything also
infrastructure toplets. If an explicit list is provided as parameter, then all toplets with these
identifiers are returned.

If a search specification is used, it has to be passed in as string reference. That string contains
the selection specification using the following simple language (curly brackets mean repetition,
round bracket grouping, vertical bar alternatives):

    specification -> { ( '+' | '-' ) group }

whereby I<group> is one of the following:

=over

=item C<all>

refers to B<all> toplets in the map. This includes those supplied by the application. The list also
includes all infrastructure topics which the software maintains for completeness.

=item C<infrastructure>

refers to all toplets the infrastructure has provided. This implies that

   all - infrastructure

is everything the user (application) has supplied.

=back

Examples:

     # all toplets except those from TM::PSI
     $tm->toplets (\ '+all -infrastructure')

B<NOTE>: No attempt is made to make this list unique.

B<NOTE>: The specifications are not commutative, but are interpreted from left-to-right. So C<all
-infrastructure +infrastructure> is not the same as C<all +infrastructure -infrastructure>. In the
latter case the infrastructure toplets have been added twice, and are then deducted completely with
C<-infrastructure>.

One assertion is a record containing its own identifier, the scope, the type of the assocation, an

both in separate lists.

    CANON   => 6

=pod

Assertions consist of the following components:

=over

=item I<lid> (index C<LID>):

Every assertion has an identifier. It is a unique identifier generated from a canonicalized form of
the assertion itself.

=item I<scope> (index: C<SCOPE>)

This component holds the scope of the assertion.

=item I<kind> (index: C<KIND>, redundant information):

For technical reasons (read: it is faster) we distinguish between full associations (C<ASSOC>),
names (C<NAME>) and occurrences (C<OCC>).

=cut

# values for 'kind'
use constant {
    ASSOC    => 0,
    NAME     => 1,
    OCC      => 2,
};

=pod

=item I<type> (index: C<TYPE>):

The toplet id of the type of this assertion.

=item I<roles> (index: C<ROLES>):

A list reference which holds a list of toplet ids for the roles.

=item I<players> (index: C<PLAYERS>):

A list reference which holds a list of toplet IDs for the players.

=item I<canon> (index: C<CANON>):

Either C<1> or C<undef> to signal whether this assertion has been (already) canonicalized (see
L</canonicalize>). If an assertion is canonicalized, then the players and roles lists are sorted
(somehow), so that assertions can be easily compared.

=back

Obviously the lists for roles and players B<always> have the same length, so that every player
corresponds to exactly one role. If one role is played by several players, the role appears multiple
times.

As a special case, names and occurrences are mapped into assertions, by

=over

=item *

setting the I<roles> to C<thing> and C<value>,

=item *

setting the I<players> to the toplet id in question and using a L<TM::Literal> as the player for
C<value>,

=item *

using the I<type> component to store the name/occurrence type,

=item *

using as I<kind> either C<NAME> or C<OCC>

Associations of this type should have one role C<subclass> and another C<superclass>. The scope
should always be C<us>.

=item C<isa>

Associations of this type should have one role C<instance> and another C<class>. The scope should
always be C<us>.

=item C<NAME>

Assertions for names should have the C<KIND> component set to it and use the C<TYPE> component to
store the name type. The two roles to use are C<value> for the value and C<thing> for the toplet
carrying the name.

=item C<OCC>

Assertions for occurrences should have the C<KIND> component set to it and use the C<TYPE> component
to store the occurrence type. The two roles to use are C<value> for the value and C<thing> for the
toplet carrying the name.

=item B<assert>

I<@as> = I<$tm>->assert (I<@list-of-assertions>)

This method takes a list of assertions, canonicalizes them and then injects them into the map. If
one of the newly added assertions already existed in the map, it will be ignored.

In this process, all assertions will be completed (if fields are missing). 

=over

=item If an assertion does not have a type, it will default to C<$TM::PSI::THING>.

=item If an assertion does not have a scope, it defaults to C<$TM::PSI::US>.

=back

Then the assertion will be canonicalized (unless it already was). This implies that
non-canonicalized assertions will be modified, in that the role/player lists change.  Any assertion
not having an LID will get one.

The method returns a list of all asserted assertions.

Example:

  my $a = Assertion->new (type => 'rumsti');
  $tm->assert ($a);

B<NOTE>: Maybe the type will default to I<association> in the future.

=item B<retrieve>

I<$assertion>  = I<$tm>->retrieve (I<$some_assertion_id>)

I<@assertions> = I<$tm>->retrieve (I<$some_assertion_id>, ...)

This method takes a list of assertion IDs and returns the assertion(s) with the given (subject)
ID(s). If the assertion is not identifiable, C<undef> will be returned in its place. Called in list
context, it will return a list of assertion references.

=pod

=item B<asserts>

I<@assertions> = I<$tm>->asserts (I<$selection_spec>)

If a search specification is used, it has to be passed in as string reference. That string contains
the selection specification using the following simple language (curly brackets mean repetition,
round bracket grouping, vertical bar alternatives):

    specification -> { ( '+' | '-' ) group }

whereby I<group> is one of the following:

=over

=item C<all>

refers to B<all> assertions in the map. This includes those supplied by the application, but also
all predefined associations, names and occurrences.

=item C<associations>

refers to all assertions which are actually associations

=item C<names>

refers to all assertions which are actually name characteristics

=item C<occurrences>

refers to all assertions which are actually occurrences

=item C<infrastructure>

refers to all assertions the infrastructure has provided. This implies that

   all - infrastructure

is everything the user (application) has supplied.

=back

Examples:

     # all toplets except those from TM::PSI
     $tm->asserts (\ '+all -infrastructure')

     # like above, without assocs, so with names and occurrences
     $tm->asserts (\ '+all -associations')

B<NOTE>: No attempt is made to make this list unique.

B<NOTE>: The specifications are not commutative, but are interpreted from left-to-right. So C<all
-associations +associations> is not the same as C<all +associations -associations>.
C<-infrastructure>.

=item B<retract>

I<$tm>->retract (I<@list_of_assertion_ids>)

This methods expects a list of assertion IDs and will remove the assertions from the map. If an ID
is bogus, it will be ignored.

B<NOTE>: Only these particular assertions will be deleted. Any toplets mentioned in these assertions
will remain. Use C<consolidate> to remove unnecessary toplets.

=item B<match>, B<match_forall>, B<match_exists>

I<@assertions> = I<$tm>->match (TM->FORALL [ , I<search-spec> ] );

I<@assertions> = I<$tm>->match (TM->EXISTS [ , I<search-spec> ] );

I<@assertions> = I<$tm>->match_forall ( [ I<search-spec> ] );

I<@assertions> = I<$tm>->match_exists ( [ I<search-spec> ] );

These methods take a search specification and return matching assertions. The result list contains
references to the assertions themselves, not to copies. You can change the assertions themselves on
your own risk (read: better not do it).

For C<match>, if the constant C<FORALL> is used as first parameter, this method returns a list of
B<all> assertions in the store following the search specification. If the constant C<EXISTS> is
used, the method will return a non-empty value if B<at least one> can be found. Calling the more
specific C<match_forall> is the same as calling C<match> with C<FORALL>. Similar for
C<match_exists>.

B<NOTE>: C<EXISTS> is not yet implemented.

For I<search specifications> there are two alternatives:

=over

=item Generic Search

Here the search specification is a hash with the same fields as for the constructor of an assertion:

Example:

   $tm->match (TM->FORALL, type    => '...',
                           scope   => '...,
                           roles   => [ ...., ....],
                           players => [ ...., ....]);

Any combination of assertion components can be used, all are optional, with the only constraint that
the number of roles must match that for the players. All involved IDs should be absolutized before
matching. If you use C<undef> for a role or a player, then this is interpreted as I<dont-care>
(wildcard). 

=item Specialized Search

The implementation also understands a number of specialized search specifications. These are
listed in L<TM::Axes>.

=back

B<NOTE>: Some combinations will be very fast, while others quite slow. If you experience
problems, then it might be time to think about indexing (see L<TM::Index>).

B<NOTE>: For the assertion type and the role subclassing is honored.

=item B<canonicalize>

I<$assertion> = canonicalize (I<$tm>, I<$assertion>)

This method takes an assertion and reorders the roles (together with their respective players) in a
consistent way. It also makes sure that the KIND is defined (defaults to C<ASSOC>), that the type is
defined (defaults to C<THING>) and that all references are made absolute LIDs. Finally, the field
C<CANON> is set to 1 to indicate that the assertion is canonicalized.

The function will not do anything if the assertion is already canonicalized.  The component C<CANON>
is set to C<1> if the assertion has been canonicalized.

Conveniently, the function returns the same assertion, albeit a maybe modified one.

I<@lids> = I<$tm>->types  (I<$lid>)

I<@lids> = I<$tm>->typesT (I<$lid>)

The method C<types> returns all direct classes of the toplet identified by C<$lid>. If the toplet does
not exist, the list will be empty. C<typesT> is a variant which honors transitive subclassing (so if
I<a> is an instance of type I<A> and I<A> is a subclass of I<B>, then I<a> is also an instance of
I<B>).

=head2 Filters

Quite often one needs to walk through a list of things to determine whether they are instances (or
types, subtypes or supertypes) of some concept. This list of functions lets you do that: you pass in
a list (reference) and the function behaves as filter, returning a list reference.

In the case that the handed-in assertion is internally reified in the map, this method will return
the internal identifier of the reifying toplet. Or C<undef> if there is none.

In the case that the handed-in URL is used as subject address of a toplet, this method will return
the internal identifier of the reifying toplet. Or C<undef> if there is none.

=head1 VARIANTS (aka "The Warts")

No comment.

=over

=item B<variants>

I<$tm>->variants (I<$id>, I<$variant>)

I<$tm>->variants (I<$id>)

With this method you can get/set a variant tree for B<any> topic. According to the standard only
basenames (aka topic names) can have variants, but, hey, this is such an ugly beast (I am
digressing). According to this data model you can have variants for B<all> toplets/maplets. You only
need their id.

The structure is like this:

  $VAR1 = {
    'tm:param1' => {
      'variants' => {
        'tm:param3' => {
          'variants' => undef,
          'value' => 'name for param3'
        }
      },
      'value' => 'name for param1'
    },
    'tm:param2' => {
      'variants' => undef,
      'value' => 'name for param2'
    }
  };

The parameters are the keys (there can only be one, which is a useful, cough, restriction of the
standard) and the data is the value. Obviously, one key value (i.e. parameter) can only exists once.

Caveat: This is not very well tested (read: not tested at all).

    my $self = shift;
    my $id   = shift;
    my $var  = shift;
