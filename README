What is it?
-----------
This base package contains Perl extensions for Topic Maps

   http://www.isotopicmaps.org/

With it you can

  - manage maps in memory

Future releases will add (please bear with me until I have this all
consolidated and documented):

  - read/write XTM files
  - read AsTMa 1.x and 2.x resources
  - read LTM resources
  - manipulate and query topic maps via an API or TMQL (query language)
  - create virtual topic maps
  - use a topic map backend store
  - a command line driven workbench (tm).

Prerequisites
-------------

Of course, TM::* relies heavily on other Perl packages. Most of them
(hopefully all) should be resolved automatically if you use the CPAN
frontend.

Installation
------------

This module should be completely installable via the cpan frontend.
To build the extensions manually, unpack this distribution somewhere,
and exercise the usual incantation:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

You will need perl version 5.8 or better to install these modules.

There may also be Debian packages for this generation.

  - discuss this in one of the topicmap mailing lists, or
  - find me in the freenode #topicmaps IRC channel (clever choice), or
  - create a bug entry in rt.cpan.org (preferred)
