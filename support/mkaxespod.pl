=head1 NAME

TM::Axes - Topic Maps, Axes for TM::match*

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The L<TM> module offers the method C<match> (and friends) to query assertions in a TM data
structure. While there is a generic search specification, it will be too slow. Instead some axes
have been implemented specifically. These are listed below.
